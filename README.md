# Lazy Film Journal

## Motivation
I am working on this project to track all I watch and keep a film journal  _with minimal effort_.
This is a perfect tool for anyone who:
- wants to practice their English by reading comments and watching videos on Youtube
- is lazy but track what you watched
- is too lazy to write a single sentence
- needs a bit of inspiration to start writing your thoughts
